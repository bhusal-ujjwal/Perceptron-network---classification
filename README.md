# Perceptron-network---classification
Explore the Perceptron algorithm for classification. Implement the perceptron classification twice - once from scratch, and once using the Perceptron available in the scikit-learn library. Additionally, Experiment with different values of the learning rate and number of epochs to observe the impact on the accuracy of the classification.

Here are the specific requirements:
Implement the Perceptron algorithm twice: once from scratch and once using the Perceptron available in the scikit-learn library.
Choose a dataset for classification that is linearly separable, and plot it to visually demonstrate its separability.
Calculate the accuracy of the classification using both implementations of the Perceptron algorithm.
Experiment with different values of the learning rate and number of epochs to observe the impact on the accuracy of the classification.
Vary the learning rate between 0.001 and 0.1, and the number of epochs between 10 and 1000.
